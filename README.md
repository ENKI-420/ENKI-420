## Why This Approach?

**Traditional job hunt**: Polish resume → apply → wait → rejection → repeat
**This approach**: Build revolutionary tech → release everything → let work speak

I'm better at building quantum compilers than writing cover letters. If you need proof of competence, read the code. If you need someone who can ship complex systems, I'm shipping daily.

## Philosophy

> "If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe." - Nikola Tesla

**Applied**: 3 tiers (theory/simulation/hardware), 6 phases (progressive validation), 9 dimensions (complete feature space)

**Result**: Systems that work.

---

**Bottom line**: I'm an engineer who builds things. Quantum compilers, distributed agent networks, AI orchestration systems, auto-healing infrastructure. I'm releasing everything because I need work, not fame. If you're hiring, the code is the interview.

**Let's build something.**
